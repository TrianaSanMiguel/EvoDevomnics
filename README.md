As a member of a research team focused on gene evolution and gene analysis, I contributed to a cross-species comparative study examining co-expression patterns and evolutionary relationships among genes across seven mammalian species. My responsibilities included performing WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis) to identify functionally relevant gene modules, as well as integrating ERC (Evolutionary Rate Covariation) analysis to uncover conserved biological processes. I assisted in curating and organizing large genomic datasets, troubleshooting analytical workflows, and interpreting results in the context of evolutionary biology. Through collaborative efforts with my peers and mentor, I helped advance our understanding of how evolutionary pressures shape gene networks over time.
